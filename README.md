Title : Single page template adaptation for Social Care Wales.

Description : Adapt a provided Figma template to a standalone HTML page.

Key Elements :
Vector Background Image. Online tools were used to merge the two background vector graphics into a single image, and to convert the image into a data URI that could be provided to the URL value of the background-image property. Handling the background image in this way allowed the page to avoid using any external assets.

Gibson Font : 
The Gibson font was added into an Adobe project and linked to. Variations throughout the document were enabled by explicit reference to weight and size. 

Inline Styling :
Most recently I have worked with Tailwind and its influence can be detected in the presence of considerable inline styling. It should be noted that the availability of multiple cursors in my IDE (PHP Storm) made the management of these inline instances very easy. I should also note that for this task embedded vanilla CSS was preferred to dependences on external libraries / files.
